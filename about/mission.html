            I believe that the alignment between one's sense of purpose and the actual engagement is crucial to stay honestly commited to it and deliver <a href="#meaningful-impact"> meaningful results</a>.

            In the long run, this plays an important role in the feeling of satisfaction by the end of the day. And the outlook towards the next day.

          <p class="h4 my-4">
            I grew up with a balance of arts and science, festivals, foods and family. I lived mostly in countryside and moved every few years. These, I think, brought me closer to appreciating nature, ecological interdependence and human potential. I value them and wish to see them grow in harmomny. I think, this gives me a sense of purpose.

            We, as human race, are at a very interesting point in history of civilization. Sometimes it feels like we are becoming more resilient, but every once in a while an event happens that reminds us of the fragility of life on earth.
          </p>
          <p class="h4 mt-4">
            Technology is evolving at a never-before speed. We are getting more interdependent and inerconnected. The human mind is experiencing psychological threats that evolution has not prepared us for. Nature and natural resources are not really being considered as a constrained resource, at least not in proportion to the economic cost of utilizing it.
          </p>
          <p class="h4 mt-4">
            This has put some (in)visible challanges in front of us. The success of most, if not all, ideas in the socio-economic space is critically affected by these factors. The bigger the potential impact of an idea, the more intense is its interaction with our state of mind and our environment. More than ever, we need to take this into account if we want to deliver some sustainable boost to the economy and make the world a better place to live.
          </p>
          <p class="h4 mt-4">
            As drivers of global economy, I think we have a collective key role to play here, not just as drivers of business, but also as drivers of socio-political and economic policy.
          </p>
          <p class="h4 mt-4">
            This is how we would add meaning to the impact we make.
